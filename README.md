# Global Superstore Orders &amp; Returns dashboard

My second dashbaord, which uses oython code to recreate the dashboard which forms both [Tableau](https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T00000C6SvOSAV/where-is-the-global-superstore-returns-file) and [Power BI] (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-power-bi-practical-course/) assignments.

Again all of the components where included, a particular highlight getting a collapsable/expandable table to work.
